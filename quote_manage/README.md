# Quote Manager
A CLI application for managing inspirational quotes.

Quote Manager is a versatile command-line interface (CLI) application built in Python, designed to efficiently manage and interact with a curated collection of quotes. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of several key software development skills and best practices:

1. Python CLI Development: The application leverages the Click library to create an intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface, showcasing the ability to design and implement effective CLI tools.
2. Package Management with Poetry: The entire project lifecycle, including dependency management, virtual environment creation, and packaging, is handled using Poetry. This demonstrates proficiency in modern Python project management techniques.
3. Database Integration: The tool incorporates SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database, illustrating the ability to integrate and manage persistent data storage within a Python application.
4. Linux System Administration: While not explicitly shown in the code, the project structure and design principles align with best practices for Linux-based applications, indicating familiarity with Linux system administration concepts.
